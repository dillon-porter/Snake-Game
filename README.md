This is a scrimba's course that teaches how to build a snake game.

Demo: https://dillon-porter.github.io/snake-game/

Note: Use your arrow keys to control the snake!
- If the snake runs into the wall or itself when its large the game is over!

This is built with JavaScript using the keycode functionality that allows you to use your arrow keys on the keyboard to move the snake to eat the apple. Everytime the snake eats the apple to grows in size and increases its speed while recording a score that is displayed. 

We also use a few JavaScript methods of .pop(), .push(), and setIntervalTime

While most of the game was built from the instructor, I took the opportunity and styled the game for a more retro look in the css file.
